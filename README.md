### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Dante and I am a Discord Developer! I am currently working on [OutLand Bot](https://outlandbot.xyz). He is a multi-purpose discord bot filled with leveling, image-manipulation, interactive games, and so much more. I am thinking to put a ModLog feature on him because that is what many discord bots do. I hope I can make a working dashboard because that will really help out and make my bot a lot simpler. Also here is OutLand's [source code.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ)
